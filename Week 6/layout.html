            A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles has found a significant correlation between the amount of time teenagers spend on social media and their mental health.

The study, which surveyed over 1,000 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18, found that those who spent more than three hours a day on social media were significantly more likely to report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.

According to the researchers, this is likely due to the constant comparison to others that social media encourages, as well as the potential for cyberbullying and other negative interactions.

The study's lead author, Dr. Sarah Coyne, stressed the importance of parents and educators taking steps to limit social media use among teenagers and promoting healthy online habits.

"It's important for parents to have open and honest conversations with their kids about their social media use and how it affects their mental health," said Coyne. "We also need to work together as a society to create a safer and more supportive online environment for our youth."
