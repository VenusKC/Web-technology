        <p><br>Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson
        in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in
        May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking
        over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and
        nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021, and has been ported to several platforms.

        In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may
        discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple
        machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or
        compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must
        acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited
        resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications,
        servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities</p>
